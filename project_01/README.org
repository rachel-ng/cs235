* General instructions:
- Fill in your name and GitHub username on top.
- Use the Notes section to add any notes to the instructor.

- Do Not add object files (anything with .o), executables, (a.out etc.) or any  files other than the .cpp files specified for the tasks to the repo.

* Project instructions

Write a program to solve either the Knight's tour or the N-queens
problem. The core function should take a board's size (8 for a
standard 8x8 board, 5 for a 5x5 board etc) and any other parameters
you need. 

It should find a solution to the problem and print out the results. 

** Knight's tour

A knight can move on a chess board in 1-2 combinations
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_%2528chess%2529][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_%28chess%29]]). A knight's tour
shows a sequence of moves where the knight visits every square once
without repeating any steps
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%2527s_tour][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour]]).

Your program should solve a knight's tour

- Use the maze code as a roadmap for your solution. Look for how the
  two problems are analagous.
- When you start, print out every move (as the maze does) to make sure
  your recursion is working but then turn off the delay or turn off
  the printouts until the end - this will make your program run much
  more quickly.
- use numbers in your board to indicate steps so put a 0 in the square
  the Knight first visits, 1 in the next etc. This way you can easily
  confirm your solution.
- Your final submission should solve a 5x5 without animation (or with
  a very fast animation).
* N-Queens problem

The N-Queens problem asks how you can place N queens on an NxN chess
board so that no queen can capture any other queen. Since queens move
any number of spaces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally that
means you can have at most one queen on any given row, column or
diagonal.

Here are more details:

See the knight's tour section for some additional general hint as to
how to proceed.



* Project specifications
- Your project should have a Makefile that has a target *main*. This
  should be the first target so typing *make* will build that target.
- The *main* target should build an executable named *main*. When run,
  *main* should print out a solved Knight's tour or N-queens board for
  a 5x5 board. Your project should work on any board size but the test
  should be for 5x5.
- You do not need unit tests for this assignment.
